        improves the conditioning of the problem and reduces the variance of
        the estimates. Larger values specify stronger regularization.
        Alpha corresponds to ``C^-1`` in other linear models such as
        LogisticRegression or LinearSVC.

    fit_intercept : boolean
        Whether to calculate the intercept for this model. If set
        to false, no intercept will be used in calculations
        (e.g. data is expected to be already centered).

    normalize : boolean, optional, default False
        This parameter is ignored when ``fit_intercept`` is set to False.
        If True, the regressors X will be normalized before regression by
        subtracting the mean and dividing by the l2-norm.
        If you wish to standardize, please use
        :class:`sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler` before calling ``fit``
        on an estimator with ``normalize=False``.

    scoring : string, callable or None, optional, default: None
        A string (see model evaluation documentation) or
        a scorer callable object / function with signature
        ``scorer(estimator, X, y)``.

    cv : int, cross-validation generator or an iterable, optional
        Determines the cross-validation splitting strategy.
        Possible inputs for cv are:

        - None, to use the efficient Leave-One-Out cross-validation
        - integer, to specify the number of folds.
        - An object to be used as a cross-validation generator.
        - An iterable yielding train/test splits.

        Refer :ref:`User Guide <cross_validation>` for the various
        cross-validation strategies that can be used here.

    class_weight : dict or 'balanced', optional
        Weights associated with classes in the form ``{class_label: weight}``.
        If not given, all classes are supposed to have weight one.

        The "balanced" mode uses the values of y to automatically adjust
        weights inversely proportional to class frequencies in the input data
        as ``n_samples / (n_classes * np.bincount(y))``

    store_cv_values : boolean, default=False
        Flag indicating if the cross-validation values corresponding to
        each alpha should be stored in the ``cv_values_`` attribute (see
        below). This flag is only compatible with ``cv=None`` (i.e. using
        Generalized Cross-Validation).

    Attributes
    ----------
    cv_values_ : array, shape = [n_samples, n_targets, n_alphas], optional
        Cross-validation values for each alpha (if ``store_cv_values=True`` and
        ``cv=None``). After ``fit()`` has been called, this attribute will
        contain the mean squared errors (by default) or the values of the
        ``{loss,score}_func`` function (if provided in the constructor).

    coef_ : array, shape = [n_features] or [n_targets, n_features]
        Weight vector(s).

    intercept_ : float | array, shape = (n_targets,)
        Independent term in decision function. Set to 0.0 if
        ``fit_intercept = False``.

    alpha_ : float
        Estimated regularization parameter

    Notes
    -----
    For multi-class classification, n_class classifiers are trained in
    a one-versus-all approach. Concretely, this is implemented by taking
    advantage of the multi-variate response support in Ridge.
