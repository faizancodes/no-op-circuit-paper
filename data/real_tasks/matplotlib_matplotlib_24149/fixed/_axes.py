        r"""
        Make a bar plot.

        The bars are positioned at *x* with the given *align*\ment. Their
        dimensions are given by *height* and *width*. The vertical baseline
        is *bottom* (default 0).

        Many parameters can take either a single value applying to all bars
        or a sequence of values, one for each bar.

        Parameters
        ----------
        x : float or array-like
            The x coordinates of the bars. See also *align* for the
            alignment of the bars to the coordinates.

        height : float or array-like
            The height(s) of the bars.

        width : float or array-like, default: 0.8
            The width(s) of the bars.

        bottom : float or array-like, default: 0
            The y coordinate(s) of the bottom side(s) of the bars.
