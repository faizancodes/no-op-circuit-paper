class InheritDocstrings(type):

    This metaclass makes methods of a class automatically have their
    docstrings filled in from the methods they override in the base
    class.

    If the class uses multiple inheritance, the docstring will be
    chosen from the first class in the bases list, in the same way as
    methods are normally resolved in Python.  If this results in
    selecting the wrong docstring, the docstring will need to be
    explicitly included on the method.

    For example::

        >>> from astropy.utils.misc import InheritDocstrings
        >>> class A(metaclass=InheritDocstrings):
        ...     def wiggle(self):

class OrderedDescriptor(metaclass=abc.ABCMeta):
    """
    Base class for descriptors whose order in the class body should be
    preserved.  Intended for use in concert with the
    `OrderedDescriptorContainer` metaclass.

    Subclasses of `OrderedDescriptor` must define a value for a class attribute
    called ``_class_attribute_``.  This is the name of a class attribute on the
    *container* class for these descriptors, which will be set to an
    `~collections.OrderedDict` at class creation time.  This
    `~collections.OrderedDict` will contain a mapping of all class attributes
    that were assigned instances of the `OrderedDescriptor` subclass, to the
    instances themselves.  See the documentation for
    `OrderedDescriptorContainer` for a concrete example.

    Optionally, subclasses of `OrderedDescriptor` may define a value for a
    class attribute called ``_name_attribute_``.  This should be the name of
    an attribute on instances of the subclass.  When specified, during
    creation of a class containing these descriptors, the name attribute on
    each instance will be set to the name of the class attribute it was
    assigned to on the class.

    .. note::

        Although this class is intended for use with *descriptors* (i.e.
        classes that define any of the ``__get__``, ``__set__``, or
        ``__delete__`` magic methods), this base class is not itself a
        descriptor, and technically this could be used for classes that are
        not descriptors too.  However, use with descriptors is the original
        intended purpose.
